## Wondering why?

Recently, my husband shared [this post](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) with me and I finally convinced myself to give it a try.

There are a lot of developers like me out there which have been doing something similar and they helped me tremendously in my journey. Probably they were/are after the same thing, namely _learning in public_. 


I've been hearing this quote said by Robert Heinlein in the developer community for awhile . I think this quote conveys a similar idea.


> When one teaches, two learn.

So, here I am. Learning in public. 

Because, let's be honest. I'll probably never stop learning, why not do it with the community? If along the way, I can also be helpful to someone, that is a huge added bonus.


## What will it be about then?

As you might already know, I'm a developer. Yet, I'm not coming from a computer science background and I'd like to deepen my knowledge and get better at it. 

I will be sharing whichever topic grasps my curiosity related to computer science and software development. It can be about data structures, algorithms, a strange problem/bug I encountered while working on a. 

I might also share something interesting about my life, but let's see what life brings us.


## Let's begin then, shall we?

Thanks a lot for reading my first ever blog post ðŸ’—.
