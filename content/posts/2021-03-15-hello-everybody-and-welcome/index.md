## Wondering why?

Recently, my husband shared [this post](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) with me from Shawn Wang in which he explains the importance of having a habit of creating learning exhaust by writing blogs, tutorials and cheatsheets, speaking at meetups and conferences, asking and answering thing on Stackoverflow or Reddit or creating Youtube videos etc. You get the point. Check out his post, he explains it very well. And I finally convinced myself to give it a try.

There are a lot of developers like me out there which have been doing something similar and they helped me tremendously in my journey. Probably they were/are after the same thing, namely _learning in public_.

I've been hearing this quote said by Robert Heinlein in the developer community for awhile. I think this quote also conveys a similar idea.

> When one teaches, two learn.

So, here I am. Learning in public.

Because, let's be honest. I'll probably never stop learning, why not do it with the community? If along the way, I can also be helpful to someone, that is a huge added bonus.

## What will it be about then?

As you might already know, I'm a developer. Yet, I'm not coming from a computer science background and I'd like to deepen my knowledge and get better at it.

I will be sharing whichever topic grasps my curiosity related to computer science and software development. It can be about data structures, algorithms, a strange problem/bug I encountered while working on a project. Or, I might also share something interesting about my life, but let's see what life brings us.

## Let's begin then, shall we?

Thanks a lot for reading my first ever blog post ðŸ’—.
